# Compiler
c-- compiler

Compiler developed by Nicholas Tice and Sammantha Vaicius

C- compiler that handles sample code and compiles it to assembly code that can be run to produce the same output.

In this compiler, we utilize a lexical analyzer, symbol table, abstract syntax tree, and assembly header files coded in C# to run and compile code.

Our compiler can handle functions, simple mathematical expressions, the declaration of arrays as well as if statements and while loops.  

Components of Compiler: lexer.l IRcode.h Makefile parser.y testProg.cmm symbolTable.h Assembly.h AST.h
