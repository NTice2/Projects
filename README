--RungeNT (School Project) [Implemented]
RungeNT is a completed project that was created with the goal of developing a ordinary differential equation solver that utilized the Runge Kutta Method. 
This is my first implementation of this method and my first attempt at creating such program.
Within this project I used my knowledge of the python language and python packages such as Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib. 
This project is complete and is updated to its current version.

--ProdsCons.c (School Project) [Implemented]
ProdsCons.c is a completed project with the goal of solving the producer consumer problem using pthreads in C. 
This is my most recent version of the project that is compiled in C using the Ubuntu Linux terminal.
For this project I had to research pthreads outside of the classroom and apply them to my code.
This project is complete and updated to its current version.

--Jokes App
My Jokes app is a locally hosted web app that users can use to log in and view jokes stored on a local MySQL database or enter new jokes after creating a new user using the web app's interface.
This app is made with PHP and utilizes MAMP to be locally hosted.
It is connected to a MySQL database and has security techniques implemented to protect against SQL Injections.  

--Personal Cloud Storage (Personal Project) [Implementation not started]
My personal cloud storage is a project I plan on implementing once I can access a Raspberry Pi model Zero 2 W or above.
My goal is to create my own personal cloud storage that I can access remotely and locally through my own cloud network.
