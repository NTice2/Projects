--RungeNT (School Project) [Implemented]
RungeNT is a completed project that was created to develop an ordinary differential equation solver that utilized the Runge-Kutta Method. 
This is my first implementation of this method and my first attempt at creating such a program.
Within this project, I used my knowledge of the Python language and Python packages such as Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib. 
This project is complete and is updated to its current version.

--ProdsCons.c (School Project) [Implemented]
ProdsCons.c is a completed project to solve the producer-consumer problem using threads in C. 
This is my most recent version of the project which is compiled in C using the Ubuntu Linux terminal.
For this project, I had to research threads outside of the classroom and apply them to my code.
This project is complete and updated to its current version.

--Jokes App 
My Jokes app is a locally hosted web app that users can use to log in and view jokes stored on a local MySQL database or enter new jokes after creating a new user using the web app's interface.
This app is made with PHP and utilizes MAMP to host locally.
It is connected to a MySQL database and has security techniques implemented to protect against SQL Injections.  

--Clinical Web App
I led a small team in the development of this application. This app serves as a mental health journaling app. 
Features included an Administrator portal, a therapist portal, and a patient portal.
MongoDB was used to securely store user logins and journal entries via text, audio, and video. 
The UI implemented was an altered version of an HTML template. The full application code belongs to the company Sensym, where I conducted research and development.
This application was apart of GCU's research development program in which I had a Full Stack Developer Team Lead role.

Other projects uploaded include various projects and side personal projects.
