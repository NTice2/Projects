--Weather App (Personal Javascript Project) [Version 1.0 Finished with plans to expand on it]
This personal project I made for fun uses the OpenWeather API to provide weather details of any city. This is made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
It features a small input box to gather a city name and fetch the weather details.
It provides Fahrenheit Temperature, Humidity %, and basic weather conditions of the given city.
I plan to expand on this web application but the working 1.0 version is completed.

--RungeNT (School Project) [Finished]
RungeNT is a completed project that was created to develop an ordinary differential equation solver that utilized the Runge-Kutta Method. 
This is my first implementation of this method and my first attempt at creating such a program.
Within this project, I used my knowledge of the Python language and Python packages such as Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib. 
This project is complete and is updated to its current version.

--ProdsCons.c (School Project) [Finished]
ProdsCons.c is a completed project to solve the producer-consumer problem using threads in C. 
This is my most recent version of the project which is compiled in C using the Ubuntu Linux terminal.
For this project, I had to research threads outside of the classroom and apply them to my code.
This project is complete and updated to its current version.

--Jokes App [Finished]
My Jokes app is a locally hosted web app that users can use to log in and view jokes stored on a local MySQL database or enter new jokes after creating a new user using the web app's interface.
This app is made with PHP and utilizes MAMP to host locally.
It is connected to a MySQL database and has security techniques implemented to protect against SQL Injections.  
Made in Android Studio using an Android emulator.

--Sensym CLinical Web App 
I led a small team in the development of this application. This app serves as a mental health journaling app. 
Features included an Administrator portal, a therapist portal, and a patient portal.
MongoDB was used to securely store user logins and journal entries via text, audio, and video. 
The UI implemented was an altered version of an HTML template. This code is the unfinished version template. The full application code belongs to the company Sensym, where I conducted research and development. 
This application was a part of GCU's research development program in which I had a Full Stack Developer Team Lead role.

--Clinical Web App
This is a beta version of a web app I started to develop individually. This app was for the Research Development Program at GCU. 
Its purpose was to make mental health and DUI screening electronic. Later in development, it was planned to have an AI grade the screening results and offer treatment recommendations.
This web app is incomplete and I have passed on development to other members of the Research development team since graduating from university.

Other projects uploaded include various school projects and side personal projects.
